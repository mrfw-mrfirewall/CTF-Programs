# CTF-Programs
The programs in this directory are short programs that I've written for CTF or CTF-like purposes.

1. dircrawl.py  -  This script was made to automate looking for interesting text in files. It was originally made for a vulnerable machine on HackTheBox.

Note: The programs here are generic and can be used elsewhere. Their purpose is to demonstrate and practice using simple python or simple scripting.
